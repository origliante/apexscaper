Hi there!
There are two crawlers:
- One is the afp_simple, which is the one working and having unit tests.
- There's a second "dynamic" crawler that, starting from quick-search.html, can look up any
of the elements of the list and crawl that particular resource - it's a proof of concept of
Oracle APEX automated crawling, so it's NOT complete

INSTALL:
# assuming you have virtualenv
mkvirtualenv afp_simple
pip install -r requirements.txt

TEST:
python -m unittest discover -s ./tests/ -p 'test_*.py'

RUN:
scrapy crawl afp_simple -L INFO -t jsonlines -o afp_simple_$(date +%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S).json

NOTES:
- tested on python 2.7
- tested on fara.org APEX 4.2
- for production, loglevel of 404 errors could need to be raised - assuming one wants to know if a site changes
